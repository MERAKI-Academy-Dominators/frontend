      <h2>What happens on the day</h2>
      <p>
        From the moment you arrive at your donation session, we will guide you
        through the process, explain what we are doing and answer any questions
        you may have about becoming a blood donor.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <h2>Welcome and preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before donating blood, please eat regular meals, drink plenty of fluid
          (non-alcoholic) and avoid vigorous exercise or exertion.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Remember to bring your completed donor health check form with you, if
          you received one from us in the post. If you ever need to cancel a
          donation appointment we ask that you give us 3 days’ notice so that we
          can offer your appointment to another donor.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          When you attend your donation session please read our welcome booklet
          - this explains the importance of blood safety.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          It's important to read this every time you attend, because advice does
          change.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          We must give you sufficient information so that you can make an
          informed choice, on the benefits and risks of donating blood and
          samples for testing.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          We will provide 500ml of fluid just before you donate. By drinking
          this over about 5 minutes, it will help with your wellbeing during and
          after donation.
        </li>
      </ul>{" "}
      <br />
      <h2>Health screening</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You will be called for private health screening, where a donor carer
          will confirm your identity. It’s critical that we guarantee an
          accurate link between you, your Donor Health Check and your donation.{" "}
          <li>
            We must ensure that it's safe for you to donate and your donation is
            safe for a patient to receive.
          </li>
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          We’ll ask some confidential questions based on your completed Donor
          Health Check. We trust your honesty when answering these personal
          questions. This will ensure your blood is safe to transfuse to
          patients.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          There is a period of time from contact with any infection to detecting
          markers in the laboratory.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>You may be referred to a registered nurse for medical queries.</li>{" "}
        <li>
          An explanation will always be provided if you are not able to donate.
          You will also be advised when to donate if you can donate, and we’ll
          encourage you to make an appointment before you leave.
        </li>
        <li>
          For your wellbeing, we must ensure you have enough haemoglobin (iron)
          in your blood before donating. Your haemoglobin (Hb) test involves us
          taking a small blood sample from your finger to test your Hb levels.
          If your test is borderline, we will offer you a confirmatory test.
          This requires a sample of blood from your arm, to be tested in a
          machine at the session. We will advise you of the result.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Following health screening, you will be asked to sit in a different
          waiting area. From here you’ll be called and invited to a donation
          chair.
        </li>
      </ul>{" "}
      <br />
      <h2>Your donation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you are comfortable on the chair, you will be asked your name,
          address and date of birth again.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Blood bags and sample tubes are labelled with unique donor
          identification numbers. All collection equipment is single use and
          sterile; only one blood bag is filled with your donation.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          A blood pressure cuff will be placed on your arm to maintain a small
          amount of pressure during your donation. The cuff is not used to
          measure blood pressure.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Your arm will be thoroughly examined to find a suitable vein before
          being cleaned with an antiseptic sponge. This kills normal flora on
          the skin (bacteria that normally exist on skin). You will see staff
          cleaning their hands frequently, using hand wipes or gels.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Donors are advised to do applied muscle tension exercises during
          donation. This is to maintain blood pressure and promote wellbeing
          during and after donation.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Following needle insertion you should be comfortable during your
          donation. If you experience any discomfort or pain please alert a
          member of staff.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          An agitator scale constantly weighs and measures your donation. It
          will stop automatically when your donation is complete.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>Donor carers will be available to you throughout your donation.</li>{" "}
        <li>
          You may hear beeping noises from the agitator, these inform us of the
          progress of your donation.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          A full donation is 470ml and will usually take between 5 and 10
          minutes.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          If you require assistance or have any concerns, please make us aware
          by raising your non-donation arm.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          After donation, the needle will be removed and a sterile dressing
          applied to your arm.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          We advise that you leave the pressure roll on for 30 minutes and the
          plaster dressing on for 6 hours. Please avoid using this arm to push
          on or to carry anything heavy.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          We will give you a card at the end of your donation with important
          care advice.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Donors are also asked to apply additional pressure to the venepuncture
          site while waiting for their drink at the refreshment area.
        </li>{" "}
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>After donation refreshment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A selection of drinks and snacks are available at the refreshment
          table. We encourage donors to relax here for at least 15 minutes and
          to have at least 2 drinks following donation.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          If you feel unwell, please remain seated and alert a member of staff
          immediately.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          Where possible, we encourage you to book an appointment for your next
          donation.
        </li>

      <h2>At home</h2>
      Please do not have a hot bath on the day of your donation.
