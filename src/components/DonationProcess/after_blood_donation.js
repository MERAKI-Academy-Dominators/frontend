      <h2>After your donation</h2>
      <p>
        During a blood donation we take 470ml of blood, which is just under a
        pint. Your donation is then transported to one of our blood centers
        where it is tested and processed before being issued to hospitals. After
        donation, your body has an amazing capacity to replace the blood you
        have given.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What to do after donating blood?</h2>
      <ul>
        To help you stay well after you have given blood, we advise you to:
        <li>
          Keep the pressure dressing on your arm for about 30 minutes after you
          have given blood, and the plaster on for 6 hours
        </li>
        <li>Rest for a short time after giving blood</li>
        <li>
          Eat and drink â€“ you will be encouraged to have at least 2 drinks and a
          snack before you leave
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid using the donation arm to carry anything very heavy for the rest
          of the day
        </li>
        <li>Avoid having a hot bath after you have given blood</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Feeling unwell after giving blood?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you feel faint (light headed or dizzy, hot, sweating, trembling,
          shaky or nauseous) lie down immediately, rest until you feel better
          and drink plenty of fluid.
        </li>

        <li>Any bruising is usually harmless and will disappear over time.</li>

        <li>
          If bleeding recurs, sit down, raise your arm and press on the area
          where the blood is coming from for at least 5 minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
