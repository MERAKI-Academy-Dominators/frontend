        <h2>How blood is used</h2>
        <h5>Blood or the components of blood are used to treat patients with medical conditions such as anaemia, <br/> cancer blood disorders, and those having surgery.</h5>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Blood components</h2>
        <h5>Blood is made up of a number of components, including red blood cells, platelets and plasma. Each of <br/> these can be used to treat many different conditions.</h5>
        <h5>Blood is usually separated into its individual components or parts, so a patient can be given the <br/> particular component they need.</h5>
        <h5>This makes the most of every blood donation, as the components in one unit of blood (or one donation) <br/> can be used to treat different patients.</h5>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Blood transfusions</h2>
        <h5>Donated blood or components are given to a patient in a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are given <br/> via an intravenous line into a blood vessel.</h5>
        <h5>Around two thirds of the blood donated in England is used to treat medical conditions including <br/> anaemia, cancer and blood disorders <br/> Nearly a third is used in surgery and emergencies including childbirth</h5>
        <h5>Usage varies between hospitals depending on their particular specialties. </h5>
        <h5>We work closely with hospitals to make sure valuable blood donations are used appropriately. </h5>
        <h5>The demand for blood from hospitals has fallen due to increased efficiency, but new donors are always  <br/> needed to make sure there is enough blood to treat those who need it.</h5>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Blood transfusions for people who are dying</h2>
        <h5>Blood can be vital for people with medical conditions or who are having surgery. But blood transfusions <br/> can also improve the quality of life for people whose illness has no cure.</h5>
        <h5>Karen Clarke, a community nurse who gives transfusions to terminally ill people in their own homes, <br/> says: 'These vital transfusions give patients a better quality of life and the energy and ability to enjoy this <br/> precious, final time with their families'.</h5>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Blood not used for transfusion</h2>
        <h5>Sometimes, blood may not be suitable for transfusion. This blood can still benefit patients in areas like <br/> the development of treatments and therapies.</h5>
        <h5>Blood can be very useful for research and training, and to help develop tests.</h5>
        <h5>We do not sell blood, or its components, for non-clinical use.</h5>
